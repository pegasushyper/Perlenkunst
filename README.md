# Perlenkunst
Perlenkunst is an WIP open-source image interpreter for pixel art generation and bead art inspiration.

## Shaders
### Limited Colorspace Shader
### Contrast Grouping Shader
Currently works with line-by-line generation.
I will implement a crawler that removes the artsy look and create accurate groupings.

## TODO
- config file
- cli
- texture control
